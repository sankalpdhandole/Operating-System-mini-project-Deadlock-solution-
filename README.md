### Operating System Mini Project: Deadlock Solution

#### Project Overview:
This mini project aims to implement and demonstrate solutions to the problem of deadlocks in operating systems. A deadlock occurs when a set of processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource.

#### Objectives:
1. Understand the concept of deadlocks in operating systems.
2. Implement algorithms to detect and resolve deadlocks.
3. Simulate a deadlock scenario and apply the solution to resolve it.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Deadlock Conditions:**
   - **Mutual Exclusion:** Only one process can use a resource at a time.
   - **Hold and Wait:** Processes holding resources can request additional resources.
   - **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from processes.
   - **Circular Wait:** A closed chain of processes exists, where each process holds at least one resource needed by the next process in the chain.

2. **Deadlock Handling Techniques:**
   - **Deadlock Prevention:** Structuring the system in such a way that at least one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot hold.
   - **Deadlock Avoidance:** Ensuring that the system will never enter an unsafe state.
   - **Deadlock Detection and Recovery:** Allowing the system to enter a deadlock state, detecting it, and then recovering.

#### Project Implementation:

1. **Step 1: Simulating Deadlock Scenario**
   - Create a simulation environment with multiple processes and resources.
   - Design processes to request and release resources in a way that can potentially lead to a deadlock.

2. **Step 2: Deadlock Detection Algorithm**
   - Implement the Bankerâ€™s Algorithm or a Resource Allocation Graph to detect deadlocks.
   - Monitor resource allocation, requests, and availability to identify cycles or unsafe states.

3. **Step 3: Deadlock Prevention and Avoidance**
   - Modify the resource request and allocation strategy to prevent deadlock conditions.
   - Apply algorithms such as resource ordering to prevent circular wait.

4. **Step 4: Deadlock Recovery**
   - If a deadlock is detected, implement a recovery strategy.
   - Strategies can include process termination (killing one or more processes to break the cycle) or resource preemption (forcibly taking resources from some processes).

#### Sample Code Snippet:

```python
class ResourceAllocator:
    def __init__(self, available, max_need, allocation):
        self.available = available
        self.max_need = max_need
        self.allocation = allocation
        self.need = self.calculate_need()

    def calculate_need(self):
        return [[self.max_need[i][j] - self.allocation[i][j] for j in range(len(self.available))] for i in range(len(self.allocation))]

    def is_safe(self):
        work = self.available[:]
        finish = [False] * len(self.allocation)
        while True:
            found = False
            for i in range(len(self.allocation)):
                if not finish[i] and all(self.need[i][j] <= work[j] for j in range(len(self.available))):
                    for j in range(len(self.available)):
                        work[j] += self.allocation[i][j]
                    finish[i] = True
                    found = True
            if not found:
                break
        return all(finish)

# Example usage
available = [3, 3, 2]
max_need = [
    [7, 5, 3],
    [3, 2, 2],
    [9, 0, 2],
    [2, 2, 2],
    [4, 3, 3]
]
allocation = [
    [0, 1, 0],
    [2, 0, 0],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [2, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 2]
]

allocator = ResourceAllocator(available, max_need, allocation)
print("System is in a safe state" if allocator.is_safe() else "System is not in a safe state")
```

#### Conclusion:
By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in identifying and resolving deadlocks in operating systems. The project will deepen your understanding of key concepts like resource allocation, process scheduling, and concurrency control.
